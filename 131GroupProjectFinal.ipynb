    "## Abstract\n",
    "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams of five players each, competing with one another to put the ball inside the opposing team’s basket. Based on common knowledge, if a team outscores its opponent, then it wins the game. NBA (National Basketball Association) is the consensus best men’s basketball league in the world. We want to dig out more factors which possibly affect the Win percentages of NBA teams aside from their field goal percentages or offensive ratings. Therefore, our study aims to determine which factors significantly affect Win percentages and thus differ a “bad” team from a “good” team. We chose five teams which have the highest average Win percentages during the past five regular seasons(2014-15 to 2018-19) as \"good teams\", and we chose five teams with the lowest average Win percentages and categorized them as “bad teams”. By visualizing the differences in many statistics between good teams and bad teams, we found several interesting variables: Field Goal Attempt (total shots), Offensive Rebounds (team gets the ball of its own miss), Block Field Goal Attempted (try to block on shots made), and Pace (number of possessions per 48 minutes). Bad teams on average scores higher in these four categories than good teams do. We did t-test on each of these variables and found that FGA and PACE do not differ much between good and bad teams. So we conducted multiple linear regressions between Wins, OREB and BLKA. We found the p-values of Offensive Rebounds and Block Field Goal Attempted are not significant for good or bad teams, but BLKA became significant when we apply the model on all teams. As a result, we reached a conclusion that if a NBA team wants to win more games, do not waste energy on trying to block every opponents' shot. "

    "## Background\n",
    "Basketball is a sport played between two teams of five players each. Two teams oppose one another and trying to shoot the basketball through defender’s hoop while preventing their own hoop from being shot through. NBA (The National Basketball Association) is a men’s professional basketball league in North America which is considered the premier men’s basketball league in the world. There are 30 teams in the NBA (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). Those teams are split into two Conferences (West and East), and are further divided into 6 Divisions (Atlantic, Central, Southeast, Northwest, Pacific, and Southwest) based on where they are located. Each year, the NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games and 8 teams with the better winning records from each Conference will go to playoffs (16 teams in total). The playoffs extend into June when the Champion team arises from the winners of each Conference. "

    "Every basketball player has a position on the court. There are five positions in basketball: Point Guard (who handles the ball and initiate plays), Shooting Guard (literally, shoot to score), Small Forward (can be scorer as well, usually the most important player in each team), Power Forward (set screens and grab rebounds), and Center (center of the team, simple). However, with the evolution of basketball, nowadays the distinction between positions is blurred. Players would take different positions depend on different rosters.  "

    "In the basketball world, players are credited in many ways. But scorers are always preferable because overall basketball is a game in which the higher scoring team wins. As 3 pointer is increasingly more valued by NBA teams, scorers who specialize in shooting 3s have become more popular. On the other hand, defenders who compete for every rebound and sacrifice their body to defend and hustle are also welcomed by NBA teams. "

    "Basketball involves five players on each team interacting with each other in an infinite number of ways. Historically, useful information, besides typical counting stats like points scored and assists made, was difficult to collect. But beginning in 2009, the league began using a video system that tracked the movement of every player on the court, and the ball, 25 times a second. These new data have pushed forward the league’s analytics movement.\n"
